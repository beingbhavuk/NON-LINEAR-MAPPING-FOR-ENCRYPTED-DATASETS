Text to Binary Converter in Python: 

This Python script converts text from a file into a binary representation. Each character in the input text is converted into its ASCII value and then represented as an 8-bit binary string.

USAGE:

1) Save the text file you want to convert (e.g., input.txt) in the same directory as this script or provide the full path to the file in the 'file_path' variable in the script.

2) Open the script (text_to_binary.py) in a text editor.

3) Run the script.

4) The script will read the input file, convert its contents to binary, and save the binary representation in a new file called 'binary.txt' in the same directory.
