Binary String Analyzer in Python: 

This Python script is designed to analyze binary strings and count duplicate substrings within them. It includes functions to generate all possible binary sets of a specified length and to count duplicate strings in a given binary input. The script is intended for use in data analysis and pattern recognition tasks.

USAGE:

1) Generating Binary Sets:

The 'generate_all_binary_sets(num_digits') function generates all possible binary sets of a specified length (num_digits) and returns them as a dictionary with the binary strings as keys and initial counts of zero.

2) Counting Duplicate Substrings:

The 'count_duplicate_strings(input_string, substring_length, mp)' function takes an input binary string, a substring length, and a dictionary (mp) for counting. It counts duplicate substrings of the specified length within the input string and appends the counts to an output file (output.txt).

3) Main Execution:

In the main() function, the script generates all possible binary sets of 8 digits using 'generate_all_binary_sets()'.
It then reads a binary input file ('binary.txt') and divides it into chunks of 1280 characters.
For each chunk, it counts duplicate substrings of 8 characters using 'count_duplicate_strings()'.
The results are appended to the 'output.txt' output file.

Run the script.
