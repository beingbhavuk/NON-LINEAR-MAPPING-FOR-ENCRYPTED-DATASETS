Non-Linear Mapping Algorithms for Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a common technique used in data analysis and visualization to reduce the number of features or dimensions of data while retaining its essential characteristics. The provided Python script utilizes relaxation-based algorithms to perform dimensionality reduction and visualizes the results using 'Matplotlib'.

USAGE:

1) Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   
   Install the required libraries (NumPy and Matplotlib) if you haven't already: 
   pip install numpy matplotlib

2) Data Preparation:

Prepare your data files in a format that can be loaded using NumPy's loadtxt function. Ensure that the data files contain the data points you want to visualize.

3) Configuration:

Customize the script according to your needs by specifying the data file paths, algorithm parameters, and visualization options.
Running the Script:

4) Execute the script

5) Visualization:

The script will generate a scatter plot that visualizes the reduced-dimensional representations of the data points obtained using the chosen relaxation algorithm.

Modifications:

User can change Number of itertations, Epsilon(Threshold of error), Learning Rate of Model to get more equivalent results.
